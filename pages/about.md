## About the Collection

This is a collection of historical photographs of the Moses Greeley Parker Memorial library, dating from the early 1900's up to the construction of the new library building in 2006. All rights to these photographs belong to the Parker Memorial Library. They have generously allowed the use of these photographs for the purposes of this collection.

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
